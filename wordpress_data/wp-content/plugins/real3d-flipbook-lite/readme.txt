== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to create a flipbook =

= How to embed a flipbook in a post or page =

= Is there a limit in number of pages or PDF file size? =

Real3D Flipbook supports 500+ MB PDF files with 1000+ pages. Only visible pages are loaded, so large number of pages does not affect the performance or loading time.

= How to optimize PDF flipbook for fast page loading? =

Typically, PDFs with a smaller file size will be rendered faster and it depends on how big a single page is. The amount of pages does not affect the performance. It's essential that you optimize your documents for the web. See Optimize a PDF from Adobe's website for more information. There are more improvement techniques that we can suggest:

1. Avoid using high resolution images -- 150 dpi resolution for scanned images shall be enough for screens, especially for low powered devices;
2. Try to use JPEG encoding for color images/photos in RGB colorspace when possible;
3. Avoid using expensive compositions/effects such as transitions/masking -- flatten transparency;
4. Avoid using PDF generators (or don't create content) that produce ineffective PDF output (e.g. LibreOffice creates a lots of tiny images for vector elements/pictures it does not understand);
5. If there is such a setting, use web-optimized PDF output / linearization;
Fix or don't produce corrupted PDFs that do not conform to the PDF32000 specification.

= How to optimize image flipbook for fast page loading? =

Optimize images for web, with online tools for image optimization or image editing software. Use images with resolution around 2000px. Use JPG or WebP instead of PNG.
